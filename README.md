Folder structure
This template follows a very simple project structure:

assets: Asset folder to store all images, vectors, etc.
components: Folder to store any common component that you use through your app (such as a generic button)

localization: Folder to store the languages files. Na
graphql: Folder to write and generate react hooks. 
util: Folder that contains logic function and hooks.
types: Folder to put any types.

Setup environments
Using scripts from console The template already has scripts to execute the project calling a specific environment defined into the package.json file. Keep in mind that if you are going to create new envs you have to define the script to build the project properly.

To define which env you want to use, just keep the structure yarn [platform]: [environment]

DEV: yarn ios or yarn android

STG: yarn ios:staging or yarn android:staging

PROD: yarn ios:prod o yarn android:prod
Also, you can use npm following the same rule as before: npm run ios:staging

Modify the environment variables files in root folder (.env.development, .env.production and .env.staging)
